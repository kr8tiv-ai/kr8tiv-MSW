# Roadmap: MSW Protocol

## Overview

MSW Protocol delivers an autonomous coding system that bridges NotebookLM and coding agents. The journey starts with browser automation (the highest-risk blocking dependency), builds the Auto-Conversation Engine (core differentiator), adds bidirectional communication and knowledge persistence, wraps everything in an MCP server, integrates with GSD and Ralph execution patterns, and culminates in end-to-end integration testing. Each phase delivers a complete, verifiable capability that unlocks the next.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (e.g., 2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Browser Automation Foundation** - Playwright wrapper with stealth, Chrome profile persistence, NotebookLM connection
- [ ] **Phase 2: Auto-Conversation Engine** - Topic detection, relevance scoring, multi-level expansion, Q&A extraction
- [ ] **Phase 3: Bidirectional Communication** - Query injection, response extraction, knowledge persistence
- [ ] **Phase 4: MCP Server** - Tool handlers wrapping all engines, multi-client compatibility
- [ ] **Phase 5: GSD + Ralph Integration** - Research-grounded planning and continuous execution with feedback
- [ ] **Phase 6: End-to-End Integration** - Full workflow validation, production hardening, documentation

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Browser Automation Foundation
**Goal**: Reliable, stealthy browser automation that can connect to NotebookLM and maintain sessions across restarts
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: BROW-01, BROW-02, BROW-03, BROW-04, BROW-05, BROW-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Browser launches with persistent Chrome profile and user remains logged into NotebookLM across process restarts
  2. Playwright can navigate to a specified notebook URL and the UI is ready for interaction
  3. Automation passes basic bot detection (no CAPTCHA triggers, no logout cascades) with humanized delays
  4. Selectors find NotebookLM UI elements via semantic/accessibility tree methods, not brittle CSS classes
  5. Response extraction correctly waits for streaming completion before returning content
**Plans:** 6 plans in 4 waves

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Project scaffold + Playwright driver + stealth config (Wave 1)
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — Chrome profile persistence + single-instance locking (Wave 1)
- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md — NotebookLM navigator + connection detection (Wave 2)
- [ ] 01-04-PLAN.md — Semantic selector registry + humanization utilities (Wave 2)
- [ ] 01-05-PLAN.md — Streaming completion detection + response extraction (Wave 3)
- [ ] 01-06-PLAN.md — Barrel exports + build verification + smoke test (Wave 4)

### Phase 2: Auto-Conversation Engine
**Goal**: Automatic exploration of NotebookLM suggested topics with relevance filtering to build comprehensive research
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (browser automation required)
**Requirements**: AUTO-01, AUTO-02, AUTO-03, AUTO-04, AUTO-05, AUTO-06, AUTO-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. System detects all suggested topic pills currently visible in NotebookLM UI
  2. Clicking a topic triggers the question and extracts the response with source citations
  3. Multi-level expansion continues through at least 5 levels of suggested topics until no new relevant topics appear
  4. Local LLM relevance scoring (0-100) filters out low-value topics before clicking
  5. Rate limit tracking displays warning when approaching 50 queries/day and batches queries intelligently
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Topic pill detection and extraction
- [ ] 02-02: Topic click automation with response capture
- [ ] 02-03: Multi-level topic expansion with depth tracking
- [ ] 02-04: Local LLM relevance scoring integration
- [ ] 02-05: Configurable relevance threshold filtering
- [ ] 02-06: Query batching and rate limit tracking

### Phase 3: Bidirectional Communication + Knowledge Persistence
**Goal**: Two-way bridge where agent errors flow to NotebookLM and grounded answers flow back, with all Q&A persisted to git
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (extraction and query capabilities required)
**Requirements**: BIDR-01, BIDR-02, BIDR-03, BIDR-04, BIDR-05, BIDR-06, BIDR-07, KNOW-01, KNOW-02, KNOW-03, KNOW-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can inject arbitrary questions into NotebookLM chat and receive structured responses
  2. Coding agent errors are automatically formatted with context and sent to NotebookLM for research
  3. Query deduplication prevents asking the same question twice in a session
  4. NotebookLM answers are injected back into coding agent context with source attribution
  5. All Q&A pairs are compiled to markdown and committed to `.msw/research/` with metadata
**Plans:** 6 plans in 3 waves

### Phase 4: MCP Server
**Goal**: MCP server exposing all MSW capabilities as tools compatible with Claude Code, Windsurf, and Cursor

**Requirements**: MCP-01, MCP-02, MCP-03, MCP-04, MCP-05, MCP-06, MCP-07, MCP-08, MCP-09, MCP-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. MCP server starts via stdio transport and responds to tool discovery requests
  2. `msw_init` tool initializes MSW state for a project directory
  3. `msw_research` tool triggers NotebookLM extraction and returns results or job ID

  2. PRD generation includes references to NotebookLM research findings
  3. Stop hook prevents premature agent exit and iteration tracking respects max-iterations
