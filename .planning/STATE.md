# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-03)

**Core value:** Zero manual copy-paste between NotebookLM and coding agents - when an agent hits an error, MSW automatically queries NotebookLM and injects the grounded solution back
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Bidirectional Communication (next core feature after auto-conversation)

## Current Position

Phase: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 complete | Next: Phase 3
Plan: - (between phases)
Status: Tracking updated - Phase 2 was complete, moving forward
Last activity: 2026-02-04 - Synchronized tracking with actual completion state

Progress: [█████████████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░] 48% (27/56 plans)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Google bot detection is highest risk - dedicated automation account required
- [Research]: NotebookLM selectors may change without notice - resilient selector layer critical
- [Research]: Stop hook Windows compatibility needs validation in Phase 5
- [07-04]: BackupManager path configurability would improve test isolation (hardcoded process.cwd() and os.homedir() paths)
- [07-06]: Coverage currently 0% on critical paths due to mocked unit tests - integration/E2E test execution needed to reach 80%+ targets
