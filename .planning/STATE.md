# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-03)

**Core value:** Zero manual copy-paste between NotebookLM and coding agents - when an agent hits an error, MSW automatically queries NotebookLM and injects the grounded solution back
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Auto-Conversation Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 9 (CI/CD Pipeline)
Plan: 5 of 5 in current phase
Status: Phase complete - Release automation deployed
Last activity: 2026-02-04 - Completed 08-05-PLAN.md (Release Automation)

Progress: [██████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 29% (16/56 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 16
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: ~3.9 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Browser Automation | 6/6 | ~90min | ~15min |
| 2. Auto-Conversation | 0/6 | - | - |
| 3. Bidirectional Comm | 0/6 | - | - |
| 4. MCP Server | 0/8 | - | - |
| 5. GSD + Ralph | 0/8 | - | - |
| 6. E2E Integration | 0/5 | - | - |

| 8. CI/CD Pipeline | 5/5 | ~26min | ~5min |
| 9. Production Hardening | 0/6 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 08-01, 08-02, 08-03, 08-04, 08-05
- Trend: CI/CD plans fastest (~5min avg) due to workflow-only changes

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Node.js runtime chosen (aligns with notebooklm-mcp, MCP SDK ecosystem)
- [Init]: Layered browser strategy (start easiest, add API and full browser as fallbacks)
- [Init]: Query batching over multi-account (smarter questions beat burning accounts)
- [2026-02-03]: Added production hardening phases for comprehensive testing, CI/CD, operational excellence
- [01-06]: Smoke test requires manual URL input to avoid hardcoding notebook IDs
- [01-06]: Barrel exports pattern established for module organization
- [07-01]: V8 coverage provider chosen for speed and accuracy
- [07-01]: Per-module thresholds: 80%+ for critical paths (auth, backup, config, degradation, browser driver, MCP tools)
- [07-02]: Shared mock factories pattern established for Playwright objects
- [07-02]: Temp directory isolation per test ensures no interference between tests
- [07-03]: Express server for mock UI allows network delay simulation and API endpoint testing
- [07-03]: Random port allocation prevents conflicts when running tests in parallel
- [07-03]: Real browser testing validates actual selector behavior against real DOM
- [07-04]: Integration tests work with file-based state (auth markers, config files, backups) rather than mocking internals
- [07-04]: Adapted integration tests to work with BackupManager's hardcoded paths (process.cwd() for config, os.homedir() for profile)
- [07-04]: Manual file restore operations simulate recovery workflows for test isolation
- [07-05]: Mock NotebookLM uses Express on random port to avoid conflicts
- [07-05]: E2E tests spawn real MCP server via stdio for realistic integration testing
- [07-05]: Test fixtures provide shared sample data for consistent E2E scenarios
- [07-06]: Vitest snapshot testing chosen for output stability validation (parseCitations, compileReport)
- [07-06]: Custom coverage validation script enforces 80%+ on critical paths vs global Vitest thresholds
- [07-06]: Multi-Node CI matrix (18, 20, 22) ensures compatibility across LTS and current versions
- [07-06]: json-summary reporter added to vitest for coverage validation script integration
- [08-01]: vitest-coverage-report-action replaces lcov-reporter for native Vitest support with regression detection
- [08-01]: E2E health checks run nightly at 2 AM UTC to avoid blocking PRs
- [08-01]: Auto-create GitHub issue on E2E failure for immediate visibility
- [08-01]: Composite actions pattern for reusable workflow components
- [08-02]: check-dist pattern validates dist/ is up-to-date with source on every PR
- [08-02]: Upload expected-dist artifact on failure enables debugging without local reproduction
- [08-03]: ESLint 9 flat config chosen over deprecated .eslintrc format
- [08-03]: Node.js globals added to ESLint for scripts/ compatibility
- [08-03]: docs/ directory ignored (contains misnamed documentation files)
- [08-03]: Warn on any usage (not error) to allow necessary cases with review
- [08-04]: dependency-review-action runs only on PRs (compares changes to base branch)
- [08-04]: npm audit runs on all triggers (checks entire dependency tree)
- [08-04]: GPL-2.0/GPL-3.0 licenses denied to prevent copyleft contamination
- [08-04]: Weekly Sunday midnight UTC scans catch newly-disclosed CVEs
- [08-05]: npmPublish: false (private project, enable later for npm distribution)
- [08-05]: Support both main and master branches for release triggers
- [08-05]: [skip ci] in release commits prevents infinite workflow loops
- [08-05]: Angular commit convention required: feat:/fix:/BREAKING CHANGE:

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Google bot detection is highest risk - dedicated automation account required
- [Research]: NotebookLM selectors may change without notice - resilient selector layer critical
- [Research]: Stop hook Windows compatibility needs validation in Phase 5
- [07-04]: BackupManager path configurability would improve test isolation (hardcoded process.cwd() and os.homedir() paths)
- [07-06]: Coverage currently 0% on critical paths due to mocked unit tests - integration/E2E test execution needed to reach 80%+ targets

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Browser Automation Foundation - COMPLETE**

All 6 plans executed successfully:
1. **01-01:** Project scaffold, BrowserDriver with stealth

6. **07-06:** Snapshot tests, coverage validation, CI workflow

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 140 tests across unit/integration/E2E/snapshot
- ✅ Snapshot tests validate output stability (response parsing, report compilation)
- ✅ Coverage validation enforces 80%+ on critical paths
- ✅ CI workflow (GitHub Actions) tests on Node 18/20/22
- ✅ Full test suite runs in ~36s (under 3-minute target)

**Coverage targets** (80%+ on critical paths) will be met as integration/E2E tests execute with real implementations.

3. **08-03:** Lint enforcement (ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier formatting)
4. **08-04:** Security scanning (dependency-review-action, npm audit, license checks)
5. **08-05:** Release automation (semantic-release, changelog generation)

**Key Workflows Built:**
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Multi-Node matrix testing (18, 20, 22), coverage upload
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - TypeScript build validation, check-dist pattern
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` - ESLint + Prettier enforcement
