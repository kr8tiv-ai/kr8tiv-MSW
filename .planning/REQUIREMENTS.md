## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Multi-Notebook

- **MULTI-01**: Notebook library management with multiple NotebookLM notebooks
- **MULTI-02**: Auto-routing selects best notebook based on query topic
- **MULTI-03**: Cross-notebook synthesis combines answers from multiple sources

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Custom relevance models trained on user's domain
- **ADV-02**: Parallel topic exploration (multiple browser contexts)
- **ADV-03**: Streamable HTTP transport for remote MCP deployment
- **ADV-04**: Multi-account rotation for rate limit scaling

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Web UI for notebook management | CLI/MCP-first for power users; adds security surface and complexity |
| Non-MCP CLI-only mode | MCP is the standard; fragmenting codebase doubles maintenance |
| Audio/podcast features | NotebookLM's job, not MSW's; irrelevant to coding agents |
| Full autonomy without guardrails | Security risk; always include max iterations, timeouts, checkpoints |
| Storing credentials in config | Security violation; Chrome profile handles auth |
| Real-time streaming without buffering | Causes partial data; wait for streaming completion |
